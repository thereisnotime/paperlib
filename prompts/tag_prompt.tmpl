I will provide you with the content and the title of a document. Your task is to select appropriate tags for the document from the list of available tags I will provide. Only select tags from the provided list. Respond only with the selected tags as a comma-separated list, without any additional information. The content is likely in {{.Language}}.

Available Tags:
{{.AvailableTags | join ", "}}

Title:
{{.Title}}

Content:
{{.Content}}

Please concisely select the {{.Language}} tags from the list above that best describe the document.
Be very selective and only choose the most relevant tags since too many tags will make the document less discoverable.
